# Pixel Tuner Studio: notes for coding agents

- Reply to the owner in Russian. Code, comments, and commit messages in English.
- Window titles and product name: "Pixel Tuner Studio". Repository: shimin/pixel-tuner-studio.
- Project package extension is `.pxpkg` (not .pixpkg, not .ptpkg).
- Stack: .NET 10 + Avalonia 12. Shared code in `src/PixelTuner.*`; platform code only in `src/Heads/*`.
- Follow each platform's guidelines: Fluent on Windows, macOS menu bar and Cmd shortcuts,
  iOS safe areas and document picker, Android back navigation and storage access framework.
- No reflection-based serialization or view location: iOS is AOT. Use System.Text.Json source
  generation (`PackageJsonContext`) and compiled bindings (`x:DataType`).
- UI strings go into `src/PixelTuner.UI/Resources/Strings*.resx` (en default, ru, de).
- `legacy/` is history and reference. Do not add features there. PixelTuner 2 must keep building
  from `legacy/PixelTuner2` exactly as before (root props are blocked by `legacy/Directory.Build.props`).
- Device protocol changes must update the JSON vectors in
  `legacy/EpicPlayer/epicplayer-mac/Tests/Fixtures/` and pass `tests/PixelTuner.Sync.Tests`.
- Merge PRs with a normal merge commit only.
- The cloud sandbox can build and test Core, Package, Sync, UI and Desktop on Linux
  (`apt install dotnet-sdk-10.0`, `SSL_CERT_FILE=/root/.ccr/ca-bundle.crt` for NuGet).
  Android needs the Android SDK (download is blocked in the sandbox) and iOS needs a Mac: rely on CI.
